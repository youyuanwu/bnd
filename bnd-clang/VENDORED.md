# Vendored windows-clang

This crate contains an experimental fork of `windows-clang`.

| Field | Value |
|---|---|
| Upstream repository | <https://github.com/microsoft/windows-rs> |
| Upstream path | `crates/libs/clang` |
| Upstream revision | `ca99b307b4e3705da54be35396a33a5afad229fd` |
| Upstream version | `0.100.0` |
| Vendored directory | `vendored/windows-clang` |
| License | MIT OR Apache-2.0 |

The vendored directory started as an exact copy of the upstream crate at the
recorded revision, including its original manifest, README, and license
files. The bnd package manifest lives one level above it and points its
library target at the vendored source.

Local experiments should modify files under `vendored/windows-clang` so the
fork remains easy to compare with upstream.

## Local changes

- Runtime libclang loading is optional behind the bnd package's `runtime`
  feature. Workspace builds use the linked libclang selected by `clang-sys`,
  avoiding feature unification with the existing `clang` wrapper and keeping
  binding regeneration deterministic.
- Plain functions and callbacks parsed from C translation units are emitted
  with the C calling convention. This preserves their source ABI instead of
  falling back to the Windows platform-default convention in RDL.
- C `long` and `unsigned long` are mapped from the widths reported by Clang
  for the active host ABI.
- Typedefs that shadow Rust primitive names are omitted to prevent recursive
  generated aliases such as `pub type bool = bool`.
- Direct and chained 128-bit integer, 128-bit floating-point, and C complex
  typedefs are omitted because WinMD cannot represent them.
- Compiler `va_list` records and typedef chains are projected as opaque
  pointers, matching their decayed C parameter ABI without exposing
  compiler-private record layouts.
- Deferred macro probes use C `__auto_type` or C++ `constexpr auto` so
  expression macros retain native signedness and pointer-sized typedef
  identity in either language mode.
- Macros cast to function-pointer typedefs are omitted because WinMD cannot
  represent function-pointer constants.
- Pointers to bare function-type typedefs collapse to the generated callback
  alias, avoiding an extra pointer indirection in callback tables.
- Typedefs whose native size is not a multiple of their required alignment,
  and functions depending on those types, are omitted because Rust cannot
  represent those layouts as concrete value types.
- Leading-underscore macros remain excluded by default; callers can
  explicitly include public names through `include_macro(s)`.
- Callers can exclude declarations for unavailable native symbols through
  `exclude_symbol(s)`.
- Function redeclaration selection preserves Clang assembly labels, ensuring
  glibc redirects such as `scanf` to `__isoc99_scanf` reach the correct
  exported symbol.
- Partial bitfield allocation units use Clang field offsets to preserve their
  exact occupied byte span and the enclosing record's native alignment.
- Explicit `scope_headers` activate the per-header reachability sweep without
  requiring an unrelated directory scope.
- Flat per-header output preserves namespaces from referenced WinMD types and
  accepts generic defining-header library overrides.
- Function declarations enumerate their direct Clang arguments so parameter
  declarations nested under function-pointer return types are not duplicated.
